{% include base_path %}

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Climate Science at UCLA, specializing in polar climates and sea ice dynamics. My research focuses on understanding the physical processes that govern sea ice  and its role in climate systems. Using statistics and remote sensing, I explore the seasonal cycles of sea ice extent - ice retreat and advance, to better predict future climate patterns.

I am a first generation immigrant and student. I aim to bridge the gap between scientific research and education, and I aspire to teach climate science and polar climates at the university level. Through my work, I hope to inspire the next generation of scientists to tackle the pressing environmental challenges facing our world today.


Antarctic Sea Ice Phase 
======

* Transport of atmospheric moisture and chemical species
* Global atmospheric circulation and regional weather extremes


For example, transport and mixing near the tropopause (~10km above the ground) can be illustrated in the animation of Ertel's Potential Vorticity (left) and O3 mixing ratio (right):
