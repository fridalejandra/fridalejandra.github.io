{% include base_path %}

My name is Frida, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Geography at UCLA, specializing in polar climates and sea ice dynamics. My research broadly focuses on understanding the physical processes that govern sea ice variations and its role in climate systems. Using statistics and remote sensing, I explore the seasonal cycles of sea ice extent - the annual advance and retreat periods, to better predict future climate patterns.

As a graduate student, part of my role involves teaching. Being a first-generation immigrant and student has often made academia feel unfamiliar, but despite the challenges, it has been incredibly rewarding. I never imagined taking this path, but through my coursework and the guidance of mentors, I have been inspired to stay curious, ask questions, and persevere. I am now dedicated to bridging the gap between scientific research and education. Through my work, I hope to inspire other students to also pursue research.

When I’m not deep in research or perfecting my figures in Matplotlib, you can find me cooking, jamming to post-punk with friends, watching thrillers, or enjoying the outdoors—most likely at the beach.

Antarctic Sea Ice Phase 
======
My current work focuses on the phase of Antarctic sea ice — the time it advances and retreats — using daily sea ice data from 2012 to 2023. The study investigates the relationship between sea ice seasonality and atmospheric circulation patterns, including the [Southern Annular Mode](https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/southern-annular-mode/), [Semi-Annual Oscillation](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~broek112/home.php_files/Publications_MvdB/2000b_VanDenBroeke_IJC.pdf), and [Zonal Wave 3] (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004GL020365), to understand the drivers of sea ice variability. By examining external forces like solar radiation alongside internal atmospheric mechanisms, the research aims to provide more accurate estimates of sea ice phase. These findings will help clarify how Antarctic sea ice responds to the atmosphere (or vice versa), contributing to improved predictions of sea ice trends and their impact on the global climate system.

For example, when we look at the annual cycle of Antarctic sea ice averaged over space (bottom) the day when the ice begins to retreat (melt~September) and advance (freeze~February) appears coherent.

Sea Ice Thickness and Volume
======
Data on sea ice thickness (SIT) is sparse and contains significant uncertainties, making it a crucial focus of my research. By utilizing satellite altimetry, specifically data from Envisat and CryoSat-2, I analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of SIT and sea ice volume (SIV) around Antarctica from 2003 to 2011. 
* The study reveals significant regional variations, with the thickest ice near the continent and more variability along the sea ice edge. This work improves our understanding of how Antarctic sea ice regulates energy exchange between the ocean and atmosphere and informs more precise predictions of sea ice trends, which are critical for understanding the global climate system.
* By examining the relationship between sea ice area (SIA) and SIT, I uncovered complex interactions, such as positive and negative correlations in different regions, which are vital for accurately estimating sea ice volume.
