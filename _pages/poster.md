## Background
Antarctic sea ice exhibits substantial variability on daily timescales, driven by short-lived atmospheric forcing1,2, superimposed on a strong seasonal cycle.

Daily variability is defined here as departures from an evolving seasonal reference frame, rather than from a fixed climatology (TAC), allowing day-to-day fluctuations to be distinguished from smooth seasonal modulation.

We use an amplitude–phase adjusted annual cycle3 (APAC) to account for interannual differences in seasonal timing and amplitude, isolating daily departures relative to each year’s evolving seasonal background.

This work investigates whether persistent daily sea ice variability provides a pathway through which short-timescale atmospheric forcing accumulates to shape seasonal advance, retreat, and the phase of the Antarctic sea ice cycle.
